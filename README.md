# AI-Chatbot
This project is a simple yet effective AI-powered chatbot built using PyTorch for neural network modeling and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques from NLTK. The chatbot is trained on customizable intents defined in a JSON file and can be extended to trigger functions or actions based on user inputs.
